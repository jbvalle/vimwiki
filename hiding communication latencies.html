Latencies usually occure in synchronous communication where the client halts all processes until it recieves a response

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
A general solution is to eliminate sychronous communication and replace it with asynchronous once

<li>
Meanwhile the client can work on other process, once a reply is recieved interrupt handler can continue that halted process

</ul>

In case user has no other choice but to wait:

<li>
In that case e.g. waiting for logging into a server, the user has no other choice but to wait

<li>
A solution would be to move part of the computation to the client. This is done by shipping the computing code to the client

<li>
For instance, when accessing a database, the necessary code for filling in a form to access the database as well as checking the correctness of the filled form can all be done at the client

<li>
The server than only recieves the finished form and can then process the form and enter it or provide information from the database
