After the birth of Linux many more flavours of unix systems had since been developed. Because of this a Convention among all unix systems was created in which a collection of Utility programs have been standardized in order for unix systems to stay portable.

The main difference between SUS and POSIX is that POSIX is a standardization for a broader range of operating systems. The main idea of POSIX is to have a standard Shell Ring compliant for a large collection of unix systems
