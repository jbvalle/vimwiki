<ul>
<li>
Some Researchers pointed out that transparency can never really be achieved

<li>
Furthermore, some pointed out that it can lead to a false understanding of the systems and how messages are exchanged, therefore making it hard to trouble shoot

<li>
Some services which are location based, ie services that depend on the locations time zone, may not work, because of the hidden location caused by location transparency

<li>
Other services which require resources or services which are geographically far away, or delays are unavoidable because of faulty infrastructure or long distances. Its better to cancel requests for services and resources to not slow down the whole system

</ul>

<p>
Conclusion:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A complete distributed systems might not be possible or even worth the effort. Its better to strive for a transparent system while wheighing out which areas are actually worth investing transparency measures.

</ul>
