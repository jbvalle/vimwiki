<p>
Here Information exchange is handled between the OS and a user program. An OS keeps its information about all its processes. Thats why systemcalls are performed to fetch data about the running processes. The executed systemcalls are getpid(), alarm(), sleep().
</p>

<ul>
<li>
getpid():

<ul>
<li>
This systemcall instructs to return the process ID of the process which is sending the syscall

<li>
This function shall always be succesful and return no errors

</ul>
<li>
alarm():

<ul>
<li>
This function arranges for a signal to be delivered to the calling process and when the delivery shall be recieved

</ul>
<li>
sleep():

<ul>
<li>
This call suspends the execution of the currently running process for a set interval of time. Meanwhile another process can be executed

</ul>
</ul>
