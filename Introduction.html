A standarized version is ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange:

<ul>
<li>
As ASCII was published in the 1960s telephone wires were used for transmission

<li>
In order to inhance performance, due to the very slow data transmission, as the data had to be converted into audo signals which is then decoded by an acoustic modem, the ASCII Code had been defined as 7 Bit code, this led to an approximately 10% better data transmission performance.

<li>
However in order to provide information on how the character should be formatted, the total 8 Bits have been used, adding extra 33 Characters serving as character formatting Information.

<li>
Program Code containing executable instructions

<li>
Size Depends on program size and pre declared data storage by the programmer

</ul>
<li>
Data:

<ul>
<li>
Contains statically allocated variables, which when initialized have fixed addresses which are unchangable onces the program is running 

<li>
Size Depends on program size and pre declared data storage by the programmer

</ul>
<li>
Heap:

<ul>
<li>
Contains dynamically allocated variables -&gt; these are allocated using malloc/new/or-any-other-quivalent

<li>
The address if a dyn. Variable is always stored in another variable -&gt; pointer -&gt; which could be an automatic variable in stack or a statically allocated variable in the data section

</ul>
<li>
Stack:

<ul>
<li>
Contains used parameters for function calls, return addresses and local variables (automaticall allocated variable, once such a variable is allocated the stack pointer is adjusted down to make space for a new variable. These Variables are always computed as an offset of the stackpointer)
