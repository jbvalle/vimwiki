<p>
The general path to exposing a hardware functionality by software is as follows.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
(Application Ring) User Process:

<ol>
<li>
this processes invokes function calls defined in LIBC

<li>
This function call is redirected to LIBC

</ol>
<li>
(Shell Ring) LIBC:

<ol>
<li>
The function call which is defined in LIBC is executed

<li>
The function call invokes the necessary systemcalls which are redirected to the kernel ring

</ol>
<li>
(Kernel Ring) Kernel Process:

<ol>
<li>
The Kernel Process executed the systemcalls programs with the highest priviliges making it possible to access the whole memory space and all devices

</ol>
</ol>

<div id="Kernel-The Properties of a kernel"><h2 id="The Properties of a kernel" class="header"><a href="#Kernel-The Properties of a kernel">The Properties of a kernel</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
The kernel process is the first thing that is loaded and executed

<li>
The is only one kernel process, but multiple user processes are possible

<li>
The Use Process invokes the system calls and waits until the kernel process handles and executes all the system calls

</ul>

Process Management:

<ul>
<li>
User Processes are created by the kernel via system calls

<li>
The Kernel is responsible for allocating the needed memory, and load the needed instructions

</ul>
<li>
Inter Process Communication (IPC):

<ul>
<li>
The kernel is responsible to enable communicatio between processes though shared memories, pipes and unix domain sockets

</ul>
<li>
Scheduling:

<ul>
<li>
Scheduling is the action handled by a task to coordinate different processes and base them on priority and importance and handle multitasking.

</ul>
<li>
Memory Management:

<ul>
<li>
The Kernel is responsible for allocating and freeing memory needed by processes as well as all memory related tasks.

</ul>
<li>
System StartUp:

<ul>
<li>
After the kernel image is loaded into main memory, its job is to initialize the userspace, by creating the first user processes with Process ID 1 and initializing hardware.

</ul>
<li>
Device Management:

<ul>
<li>
The kernel is also responsible for handling real and virtual hardware by handling the memory mapped device files used by user processes for communication

</ul>
</ul>
