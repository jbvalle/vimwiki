<p>
This type of DS System in essence distributes the computation usually done buy only one server. This comes in 3 types:
</p>

<div id="distributed computing systems-Cluster Computing"><h2 id="Cluster Computing" class="header"><a href="#distributed computing systems-Cluster Computing">Cluster Computing</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
consists of a collection of workstatios or pc connected by means of high speed LAN local network, usually running the same hardware and operating system

<li>
Such a system usually is administered by a single master node, managing all other nodes in the cluster

<li>
The middleware in this case actually run on the master node, while the other nodes are equipped with normal OS and middleware function to enable communication, storage, fault tolerance etc.

<li>
An Example of such a system is the Linux based MOSIX System. Its high transparency is achieved by applying dynamic preemptive process migration, making it possible to start a process in one node, but processing it at another node for most efficient use of resources

</ul>

<div id="distributed computing systems-Grid Computing"><h2 id="Grid Computing" class="header"><a href="#distributed computing systems-Grid Computing">Grid Computing</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Often constructed of enteties of computer systems, in which each system is asigned its own administrative purposes, which can all be different in software and hardware

<li>
   ^   

</ul>
<div id="distributed computing systems-Cloud computing"><h2 id="Cloud computing" class="header"><a href="#distributed computing systems-Cloud computing">Cloud computing</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
This type is an outsourced version of entire infrastructures and services to offer compute-intensive applications

</ul>
