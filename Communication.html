<p>
Here the kernel handles communication between processes.
</p>

<p>
Two models are used for inter-process communication:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Message Passing: Meaning processes exchange messages with one another

<li>
Shared Memory: Processes share a memory region in order to communicate

</ul>

<p>
Systemcalls that are sent are: pipe(), shmget(), mmap()
</p>
<ul>
<li>
pipe():

<ul>
<li>
This syscall is used to enable inter-process communication between processes

<li>
pipe() is used to open <a href="file-descriptors.html">file-descriptors</a>

</ul>
<li>
shmget():

<ul>
<li>
stands for shared memory segment

<li>
this syscall is used for shared memory communication

<li>
this syscall is sent in order to access the shared memory and thereby access the messages within the memory in order for processes to communicate

</ul>
<li>
mmap():

<ul>
<li>
This syscall is used to map or unmap files or devices into the content of virtual memory space of the processes

</ul>
</ul>
