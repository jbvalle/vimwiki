<div id="Risc Design Philosophy-ARM Company"><h2 id="ARM Company" class="header"><a href="#Risc Design Philosophy-ARM Company">ARM Company</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Mainly  a design firm - do not produce hardware

<li>
Sell the licenses to brands

</ul>

<div id="Risc Design Philosophy-RISC"><h2 id="RISC" class="header"><a href="#Risc Design Philosophy-RISC">RISC</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Reduces instruction set computer used by ARM Processors

<li>
Contrary CISC is used by x86 Processors

<li>
Instructions are executed in parallel by pipelines

<li>
Have large general Purpose register set to be more flexible

<li>
Processors operates on data held in registers by load-store

</ul>

<div id="Risc Design Philosophy-ARM - Design Philosophy"><h2 id="ARM - Design Philosophy" class="header"><a href="#Risc Design Philosophy-ARM - Design Philosophy">ARM - Design Philosophy</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
ARM Cores are design for less power consumption

<li>
ARM is a compromis of RISC - High Code density - better Power Consumption

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
RISC:

<ul>
<li>
RISC Design Philosophy is simplicity over complexity

<li>
Because of that, greater emphasis have been put unto the compiler which handles the simple instruction set and figures out the complex function behind it -&gt; it then produces the simplified excutable

</ul>
<li>
CISC:

<ul>
<li>
In CISC the greater emphasis has been put unto the CISC Architecture design which is responsible for understanding the the complex instructions and executes the binary

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Risc Design Philosophy-Further Differences"><h2 id="Further Differences" class="header"><a href="#Risc Design Philosophy-Further Differences">Further Differences</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Endianess:

<ul>
<li>
Risc: Little Endian, big endian

<li>
CISC: little endian

</ul>
