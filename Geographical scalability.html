In this case loss of perfomance is not noted by the distance of the user and the geographically places resource of the system

<ul>
<li>
Client-server interaction:

<ul>
<li>
this kind of interaction works find in LAN configuration, but because of its synchronous nature, one instance sends a request and blocks until it recieves a respond. As mentioned this works find in a LAN but if the geographical location is far away this could lead to high delay time

</ul>
<li>
Limited bandwidth:

<ul>
<li>
porting a system to a wide area network is often coupled with limited facitlies , bad communication reliability. A real time system may face issues to to unreliable communication and restricted bandwidth.

</ul>
<li>
Not enough multipoint facilites:

<ul>
<li>
Broadcast and multipoint messages work well in LAN but WAN are ofted restricted of multipoint facilities. This multipoint capability however is essential from a management point of view to discover components and services. This problem can be overcome by creating support services, ie naming and directory services, in which query requests are sent. This support service in turn needs to be scalable.
