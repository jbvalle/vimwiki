<p>
Device drivers make it possible for developers to interact with the kernel, without having to directly modify kernel source code. Therefore making it easier to handle that massive code base.
</p>

<p>
A special feature of device drivers is their modularity , which makes it possible to be programmed separately from the kernel and be plugged in during runtime if necessary, this special feature makes to very easy to write drivers.
